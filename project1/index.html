          Dash
        </h3>  
        Dash was a team game that me and three other developers made for our Game Design and Algorithmic Problem Solving 2 course final. Dash is a singleplayer top-down rouge-like that features an endless mode and an adventure mode. The game was created using the monoGame extension for Microsoft Visual Studios. I was responsible for the characters and sprites as well as structuring classes and inheritence. The majority of the time spent on the project was in the character class where I used the sprite sheet to create basic movement animations for the character.

        <h3>Cat Racing Game (Title Pending) *</h3>
        The cat racing game is exactly as it sounds. A game that combines the cuteness of furry cats and the aggressiveness of a fast paced racing environment with guns! This game is an eight person project that we are developing in Unreal Engine which is a first for any of us. The game is meant to be a fun project that is also educational for each of us.

        <h3>Master Sword</h3>
        The Master Sword from Legend Of Zelda was the reference for this 3d asset which I created as an assignment in my 3D Animation and Asset Production course. The model was created using Autodesk Maya while the textures were created using Adobe's 3d Substance Painter. I decided to use a gold blade instead of the traditional silver to make it stand out a little more than just copying the original.

        <h3>PokeSearch</h3>
        Pokesearch is a website I designed using the online open source Poke Api. The site allows you to  search for any number of pokemon given thier type and generation. It also allows the list of results to be sorted alphabetically by name and also by type if none was selected. <a href="https://people.rit.edu/rbl2991/235/project2/">Click Here</a> to visit pokesearch!
