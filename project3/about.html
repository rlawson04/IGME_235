    <div>
        For project three I am going to be using the circle blast exercise and revamping it to look like a retro shooter. My inspiration for this project are games like Space Invader and Galaga. Some things I will implement besides a new font style, are new weapons, controls, and enemies. I will also change the background from solid black to a scrolling space scene. Finally, I want to add a highscore page that takes the userâ€™s name and stores the data locally.
        <br><br>Pictured below are the main home screen and a rough sketch of the game loop.
